# CPU Scheduling and MultiCore
Now we are here with the fun part of this project: Creating a CPU Scheduler and implementing a multi-core implementation. This will be a challenge but the performance will be there. In this module, we will implement multiple things to get this to work. We will need to enable the MMU for the cache, testing to show the performance, and a way to prioritize tasks.
